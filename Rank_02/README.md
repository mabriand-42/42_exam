Here you'll find all exercises from the first exam of the new 42 cursus.
During this session, you'll have to pass either _inter_ or _union_ to be abble to try _get-next-line_ or _printf_.

I would recommand you not to focus only on _get-next-line_. Event though it's definitely the simplest and shortest
one to revise, you can waste a lot of time waiting for this subject to come. However: it's up to you!
