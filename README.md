Here you'll find all exercises from exams of the new 42 cursus. Good luck!

## Rank_02 ## 

During this session, you'll have to pass either _inter_ or _union_ to be abble to try _get-next-line_ or _printf_.

I would recommand you not to focus only on _get-next-line_. Event though it's definitely the simplest and shortest
one to revise, you can waste a lot of time waiting for this subject to come. However: it's up to you!

## Rank_03 ##
